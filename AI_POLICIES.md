# AI policy ledger

Every bot policy, its design, and its measured performance. Update this file
whenever a policy is added, changed, or re-benchmarked. RL training plan and
post-mortems: RL_PLAN.md.

## Using policies

Registered by name in `server/shengji/ai/registry.py`; the server reads
`SHENGJI_BOT` (**default `mc`**):

```bash
SHENGJI_BOT=smart uv run shengji-server   # e.g. an easier table
```

Benchmarking (always mirrored deals — each seed runs twice with teams
swapped, so card luck cancels; identical policies score exactly 50/50):

```python
from shengji.ai.env import evaluate
from shengji.ai.registry import make_bot
evaluate(make_bot("mc"), make_bot("smart"), n_games=300)
```

Multi-policy Elo: `uv run python -m shengji.ai.tournament`. Human-agreement
tripwire: `uv run python scripts/eval_vs_human.py "../logs/*.jsonl"`.
Noise guide: ±3% at n=200, ±2% at n=400; round-level evals ±4.5% at n=120.

## The ladder (Elo, round-level, heuristic = 1000)

IMPORTANT caveat learned 2026-08-01: Bradley-Terry ratings are
POOL-RELATIVE — absolute numbers shift with pool composition (mc rated
1141, 1104, and 1137 across three pools; anchors move too). Only
within-pool gaps and head-to-head rates transfer between tables.

**Latest pools (2026-08-01 night, post-throw-fix code):**

| policy | Elo | pool | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| **mc** (server default) | **1141** | A | champion; beat rl-v5 53%, mc-v5roll 63%, rl-v6 60% |
| rl-v5 (bare net) | 1088 | A | distilled net, no search at inference (~2ms/decision) |
| mc-v5roll | 1074 | A | net-as-rollouts DEGRADES search — its 55% preview vs mc (n=40) reversed to 37% at n=60; bare net out-rates its own hybrid |
| smart (v3) | 1055 | A | |
| rl-v6 | 1032* | B | *pool B (mc 1104, smart 1006): ~25-30 above smart, ~70 below mc — v6 is the strongest standalone net (see rl section) |
| heuristic | 1000 | A+B | anchor |

Earlier pools (same day, pre-throw-fix code): mc 1137 > mc-smartroll
1129 (tie at 5x cost) > mc-argmax 1092 (margin worth ~45 Elo) >
mc-lite 1077 > smart 1032 ≈ smart-v1 1022 ≈ smart-v2 1020 > heuristic
1000.

Full-game rates compress/amplify differently: smart beat heuristic 86-90%
of GAMES while only ~52% of rounds — game wins come from winning rounds
BIGGER (brackets), compounding over ~37-round games.

## Active policies

### `mc` — MCBot (server default)
Determinized Monte Carlo (`ai/mcbot.py`): samples 10 opponent-hand worlds
consistent with public info (hand sizes, observed voids, card counts; own
kitty knowledge as banker), rolls ≤8 candidates to round end with heuristic
rollouts, argmax — guarded by:
- **Confidence margin** (5.0 pts/round): candidates[0] is SmartBot's pick;
  the search overrides only when it wins by the margin. Rollouts are
  noisiest early; the margin is worth ~45 Elo vs pure argmax.
- **TRACTOR_LOCK**: heuristic tractor leads are final (56% vs unlocked).
- **Point-shy tiebreak** (2.0): among near-tied candidates, risk the fewest
  points (a beaten 10-10 lead gifts 20 immediately).
- ~30ms/decision (invisible inside the 0.7s bot pacing); ~400x slower than
  heuristics in headless sim — benchmark with small n or round-level.
- Hyperparameters fully swept and flat: N∈{5..30} (N=10 best), margin
  {0,2.5,5,7.5,10} (5 best), candidates {4,8,12} (8), SmartBot rollouts
  (tie at 5x cost), LEAD_MARGIN {8,12,999} (ties), LEVEL_OBJECTIVE / MC_BURY
  toggles (ties, available off by default). **Flat-MC is plateaued**; next
  strength requires learned evaluation (RL_PLAN.md).
- vs SmartBot v2: 36-4 (90%) mirrored full games, n=40.
- Exposes `last_eval` (per-candidate values) for search distillation, and
  powers the /debug/xray live inspector.

### `smart` — SmartBot v3
`ai/smart.py` + `ai/memory.py`: heuristic layered with public-information
memory — card counting, boss detection ("is this the highest card still
out?"), void inference, ruff/beat risk. Leads safe throws (every component
provably unbeatable) → boss pairs/tractors → tractor pressure → boss
singles; always contests in-suit (tempo); spends trump only on tricks worth
taking; feeds points only when partner's win is secure; buries toward voids
gated on trump strength; endgame control (contest everything in the last ~6
tricks); eager declaration (8/6 thresholds).
Lineage (all mirrored vs heuristic): v1 (memory only) 66% → v2 (+safe
throws +17pt, bury-to-void, eager declare) 86% → v3 (+endgame control +2,
trump-gated bury +1) ~88-90%. Registry keeps smart-v1/smart-v2 reproducible.

### `heuristic` — baseline
`ai/heuristic.py`: stateless rules; the fixed reference (Elo anchor 1000).

### `rl` — RLBot (experimental, opt-in)
`rl/torch_policy.py`: Q-net (QNet or dueling QNetDueling, auto-detected)
argmaxing over enumerated legal actions; needs `uv sync --group rl` +
`SHENGJI_RL_CKPT` (checkpoints local, gitignored).
- **Checkpoint ladder** (gates = mirrored n=120 vs SmartBot / vs MCBot):
  | ckpt | method | vs Smart | vs MC |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | ckpt_bc | BC of SmartBot (20k rounds) | 48% | 29% |
  | ckpt_bc_dueling | same, dueling arch | 38% | — |
  | ckpt_distill_full (v5) | search distillation, full data, 5 ep | 42% | 38% |
  | **ckpt_distill_v6** | same, 12 epochs | **51%** | **41%** |
  v6 is the strongest standalone net: beats BC on both axes, parity-plus
  vs SmartBot, Elo ~25-30 above smart / ~70 below mc in its pool. The
  distillation series (v1-v3 failed at 32/22-ish; v4 soft targets 38/32;
  v5 42/38; v6 51/41) — full iteration history in RL_PLAN.md.
- **Dueling-architecture tax (measured)**: at near-equal imitation
  (88.2% vs 89.7%), dueling-BC plays 10 points worse than free-logits BC
  (38% vs 48%) — mean-zero A is a poor medium for a policy; free policy
  heads win for play, dueling only where value regression happens.
- **Hybrids (net-as-rollout-policy): measured dead end.** BC-hybrid 45%
  vs mc (n=40); v5-hybrid previewed at 55% (n=40) then REVERSED to 37%
  at n=60 — the bare v5 net out-rates its own hybrid in the pool (1088
  vs 1074). Net tail-failures get amplified by search, at ~100x cost
  (~2s/decision); a human player's "feels wonky" preceded the
  statistical verdict. Phase 4's remaining path: truncated rollouts +
  value-head leaves (unbuilt), which must beat plain mc to matter.
- **Ballot-mismatch incident (2026-08-01)**: the exhaustive-follow
  enumeration change silently broke the deployed net — trained on
  search-candidate ballots, it was suddenly scoring dozens of unseen
  action encodings at play time and collapsed to **Elo 798** in the pool
  (18% vs SmartBot). Fixed by matching play-time ballots to the training
  distribution (exhaustive mode retained for human-coverage analysis);
  recovery verified at exactly 48%. Lesson: encoding/enumeration changes
  invalidate every trained checkpoint — bump versions and re-verify.
- DMC self-play recipe v1: **closed** — flat ~30-34% vs SmartBot across
  400k rounds; measured cause: value regression crushed the BC score scale
  (cross-candidate spread 22.5 → 0.26 ≈ action-blind) under deal-luck
  label noise. Run record: `server/runs/dmc_v1.md`.
- **DMC self-play: still unsolved** — dmc2 (anchor + oracle baseline +
  gating + spread alarm) halted twice by its own alarm: Q-regression
  toward near-unpredictable advantage targets collapses ANY policy
  pathway it trains (regress-to-mean → action-blind), even
  scale-matched. Designed fix, unbuilt: AWAC-style advantage-weighted
  policy-head update. Oracle baseline validated offline (43-47% of
  outcome variance explained).
- **Overnight sweeps (2026-08-02, all probed vs current SmartBot on fixed
  seeds; CONTROL: v6 = 55%)**: temperature 0.03/0.10 → best 52%/52%
  (**null — 0.05 was right**, and sharp targets train unstably);
  big-trunk 1024 → best 47% (**null — capacity doesn't help; stay small**);
  v6.1 human-blend ep0 → 50% strength (within noise of v6) and
  **57% human-agreement vs v6's 51%** — the blend took: 801 samples
  moved style +6pts at no strength cost. Caveat: partly in-sample
  (trained on this corpus); the clean test is agreement on FUTURE games. Recipe robustness confirmed →
  **v7 = v6's exact recipe on the N=30 low-noise textbook** (20k rounds,
  24 shards, pairfix+voiddump teacher) — TRAINING NOW with per-epoch
  snapshot probes. Plan, gates, full history: RL_PLAN.md.

## Shared-code changes affecting ALL policies

- **Memory.pair_void (2026-08-02)**: per-seat proof of "no pair left in
  this suit", inferred from the forced pair-matching rule (a follower who
  answers a pair/tractor lead with fewer in-suit pairs than led has, by
  rule, none). Free public info available to every consumer. The
  heuristic lead gate built on it (PAIR_VOID_BOSS) tied at n=400; the
  sharper queued use is constraining MC's world sampling.

- **CURRENT pool (2026-08-02 ~02:45, all four night upgrades incl.
  CONTROL_LEADS + TEMPO_GUARD, seeds 3000)**: mc 1067 > **smart 1061
  (statistical tie with the champion — mc's head-to-head edge narrowed
  to 53%)** > rl-v6 1023 > heuristic 1000. The night's heuristics closed
  most of the search's margin; the frozen net now trails both hand-built
  tiers (smart beat it 58%) — the bar v7 must clear. Human-agreement on
  the 827-decision corpus: heuristic/smart/mc all 55%, rl-v6 51%.
- **2026-08-02 night, four user-sourced upgrades (all adopted, stacking)**:
  pair_is_boss (+13pt, below), **TEMPO_GUARD** (no premium trumps on 0-point tricks — XCYB BJ incident), **VOID_DUMP** (junk dumps empty short suits
  first — 55% h2h vs prior smart, n=150), **CONTROL_LEADS** (leader
  hierarchy: non-boss pairs J+ → short-suit emptying → forcing non-point
  singles → junk last — **67% h2h, n=150, largest single-toggle gain
  measured**). Post-fix Elo re-baseline (seeds 2000): mc 1097 > rl-v6
  1068 > smart 1012 > heuristic 1000 (v6's apparent rise vs smart was
  noise: n=240 recheck = 54%, matching pre-fix). Pending measurement:
  RISKY_THROWS (near-boss A+QQ throws on MCBot's ballot), TRUMP_BALLOT
  (trump pair/top-trump candidates). Night record: server/runs/night_20260801.md.
- **2026-08-01 ~23:55 pair_is_boss fix (+13pt)**: pairs are beaten only by
  higher PAIRS — the old any-higher-card check vetoed unbeatable pairs
  (holding A+KK, AA is impossible, yet KK read "not boss"). User-spotted
  from prod-log lead-shape analysis (bots: 86% single leads, AA+K present
  but A+KK absent — the exact fingerprint). Post-fix smart vs heuristic:
  **89%** (was 76% on identical seeds). Affects SmartBot leads, MCBot
  candidates/rollouts, and all teacher data generated AFTER the fix (the
  N=30 overnight set spans it — regenerate-or-accept decision pending).
  All Elo/gate numbers measured before this are pre-pairfix.

- **2026-08-01 throw-ruffing fix**: no bot could contest a 甩牌 (candidate
  generator returned None for multi-component leads). Now all bots build
  shape-matching trump sets. Smart-vs-heuristic compressed 90% → 76% on the
  same seeds (the baseline can now punish safe throws — SmartBot's
  signature weapon). Numbers dated before this are pre-fix; Elo pool rerun
  pending.
- 2026-07-31 rules corrections (defend-at-A, format-scaled kitty
  multiplier) similarly shifted all measurements made before them.

## Toggle registry (canonical) — every flag, what it does, and its record

**SmartBot / HeuristicBot** (h2h = head-to-head vs same bot without the flag):

| flag | default | what it does | record | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SAFE_THROWS | ON | leads multi-part throws (甩牌) only when card-counting proves every part unbeatable — free multi-card winners, penalty can never trigger | +17pt vs heuristic | adopted |
| CONTROL_LEADS | ON | when in the lead with no boss cards: try pairs (J+) first, then empty a 1-2 card suit, then a forcing high non-point single — junk only as true last resort | 67% h2h, n=150 | adopted |
| LATE_TRUMP_PAIRS | ON | with ≤12 cards left, lead the top trump pair — depleted opponents can't answer pairs (mined from human play: +7.3/decision, 8/8) | 60% h2h, n=150 | adopted |
| VOID_DUMP | ON | when discarding junk, shed from the SHORTEST suit first — empties suits to open future ruff opportunities | 55% h2h, n=150 | adopted |
| TEMPO_GUARD | ON | refuses to spend rank-trumps/jokers winning tricks worth 0 points (prod bot once burned BJ beating a rank-4 for nothing) | root-fix, verified on position | adopted |
| ENDGAME_CONTROL | ON | in the last ~6 tricks, contest every winnable trick regardless of points — controlling the finish beats saving cards | +2pt | adopted |
| BURY_TRUMP_GATE | ON | banker buries kitty points only when trump is strong enough to defend the last trick (11+ trumps incl. big joker); weak trump = never bury points | +1pt | adopted |
| BURY_VOID | ON | banker's bury deliberately empties 1-3 card suits (ruff setup) instead of spreading discards | ~+1pt | adopted |
| DECLARE 8/6 | ON | declares trump at 8 projected trumps (7 in the grace window) — eager beats waiting for a perfect hand (10/8 measured −4) | +2pt vs 9/7 | adopted |
| SAFE_TRACTOR_ONLY | ON | won't lead tractors into suits where an opponent has shown void (they'd get ruffed) | disabling: −4 | adopted |
| TEMPO_SEEK v2 | off | spends trump (even jokers, if the prize is big) to win the lead when boss pairs/tractors are waiting to be played | v1 48%, v2 53%, combo 49% n=200 | tie — noise |
| ANY_PAIR_OVER_JUNK | off | last-resort leads prefer any pair (even low) to a passive low single | 52%; combo 49% | tie — noise |
| TRACTOR_FIRST | off | ranks tractors above boss pairs in the lead order | 51% h2h | tie (tractors already led at step 2) |
| PARTNER_VOID_LEAD | off | leads suits your partner is void in so they can ruff for points | 50% alone, −4 combined | rejected |
| DECLARE_TUNE | off | declares the WEAKER of two long suits + extra-eager on point levels (5/10/K) — folk wisdom from strategy guides | −2pt | rejected |
| TRUMP_DRAIN | off | leads boss trumps from long holdings to strip opponents' trumps early | −4pt | rejected |
| TRUMP_DRAIN_V2 | off | same idea, banker-side only with cheap trumps (expert-conditioned version) | −4pt | rejected |
| FEED_ON_TRUMP | off | throws point cards to a partner winning with trump even when they could be overtrumped | −9pt | rejected |
| RESERVE_LAST | off | attackers hold back a boss pair/tractor for the last trick (kitty multiplier) | −11pt | rejected (hoarding loses) |
| SIZE_FIRST | off | strict "more cards is better" lead order: any ruff-safe tractor, then any ruff-safe pair, before all smaller leads | 52% h2h, n=200 | tie (consistent with its halves TRACTOR_FIRST + ANY_PAIR_OVER_JUNK both null) |
| PAIR_VOID_BOSS | off | leads a LOW pair once every opponent has PROVEN pair-void in its suit (forced pair-matching makes a broken answer proof) | 54% first n=200, 48% fresh n=200 → 51.0% at n=400 | tie — small-n mirage caught by extension; Memory.pair_void tracker kept (see shared-code changes) |

**MCBot** (search-level knobs on top of SmartBot):

| knob | value | what it does | record | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MARGIN | 5.0 | SmartBot's pick is the incumbent; the search only overrides it when a candidate wins the rollouts by 5+ points/round — guards against early-round rollout noise | beat argmax 62% (~45 Elo) | adopted |
| N_DETERMINIZATIONS | 10 | how many hidden-hand worlds are sampled per decision | 5→48%, 10→62%, 15→65%, 30→61% | adopted (≥10 flat) |
| MAX_CANDIDATES | 8 | how many candidate plays the search evaluates | 4→58%, 12→60% | adopted |
| TRACTOR_LOCK | ON | when the heuristic wants to lead a tractor, that's final — no rollout override | 56% h2h | adopted |
| POINT_SHY_EPS | 2.0 | among near-tied candidates, play the one risking the fewest points (a beaten 10-10 lead gifts 20) | from the 10-10 lead analysis | adopted |
| LEVEL_OBJECTIVE | off | scores rollouts by scoring brackets (the 80/40-point cliffs) instead of raw points | 59% vs 62% ref | tie |
| MC_BURY | off | searches the banker's bury: heuristic pick vs loose/strict/no-void variants over sampled worlds | 62% = ref | tie |
| LEAD_MARGIN | off | a higher override bar for leads specifically | 8/12/999 → 51/47/50% | tie |
| SmartBot rollouts | off | uses the memory-aware bot instead of the fast heuristic to play out sampled worlds | Elo tie at 5x cost | rejected |
| RISKY_THROWS | off | puts near-boss throws (A+QQ where only one higher pair threatens) on the ballot; worlds price the risk | 53% at MC, n=120 | tie (combo w/ TRUMP_BALLOT pending) |
| TRUMP_BALLOT | off | adds trump-pair and top-trump lead candidates (钓主) for the worlds to price | 53% at MC, n=120 | tie (combo pending) |
| WIDE_LEAD_BALLOT | testing | leads roll out EVERY pair, tractor, and near-boss throw in every suit incl. trump (lead cap 8→14). Fix for the JVRA sourcing gap: ♣A♣A/♣8♣8 never reached the rollouts | mc-vs-mc n=120 in flight | pending |

**Engine corrections** (not flags — permanent): throw-ruffing (all bots
can contest 甩牌), pair_is_boss (+13pt), beats() alternative
decompositions, defend-at-A, format-scaled kitty multiplier, throw
penalty forces the beaten component, exhaustive-follow enumeration
(analysis-side).

## Sourcing-miss audit (2026-08-02, human corpus n=1052)

15.3% of human plays are ABSENT from the bot's play-time ballot (v1):
lead throws 77% missing (2/4-card throws: 100%), follow singles 21%
(discard selection — biggest absolute bucket, 116/558), broken-structure
follows 12-17%. Direct confirmation that the gap is sourcing, not
ranking. Fixes staged: ballot v2 lead throws (RL, next teacher gen),
WIDE_LEAD_BALLOT (MC, in measurement), wide-follow ballot (queued).
**Same-day fix loop**: v2 enumerator (exhaustive follows + safe/near-boss
throws) cut misses to 2.3%; adding arbitrary 2-3 component throws per
suit (humans throw riskier than near-boss) cut them to **0.7% — 99.3%
coverage**. Tracked tripwire: `scripts/audit_sourcing.py` (--v2).
Direct net duel same day: rl-v6 beat rl-v5 54% (108-92, n=200) — v6
confirmed the stronger net; old cross-pool Elo suggesting otherwise was
pool-relativity.

## Experiment log (measured and rejected — reproducible via registry/toggles)

| idea | result | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| last-trick reserve (`smart-reserve`) | 55% alone, -15pt combined | hoarding loses; expert version (endgame control) adopted instead |
| trump draining v1 (`smart-trumpdrain`) | -4% | wastes trump control |
| trump draining v2 (banker-side, cheap trumps) | -4% | lost a third time, even expert-conditioned |
| feed on any partner ruff (`smart-feedtrump`) | -9% | overtrumped feeds gift points |
| tractor leads into ruff risk (`smart-anytractor`) | -4% | ruffed tractors lose big |
| conservative declaration (10/8) | -4% vs 8/6 | declaring is worth more than a perfect hand |
| declare the weaker suit + point-level eagerness | -2% | suit quality matters more than folk wisdom claims |
| partner-void feeding | neutral alone, -4% combined | interferes with endgame control |
| LEAD_MARGIN 8/12/999 (tempo hypothesis) | 51/47/50% ties | margin-5 + heuristic prior already filter the passive-rollout lead bias |
| TRACTOR_FIRST (tractors above boss pairs) | 51% h2h tie, n=150 | tractors already prioritized at step 2 + tractor-lock; the ordering margin is rare |
| TEMPO_SEEK (cheap trump for the lead when boss follow-up waits) | 48% h2h tie, n=150 | in-suit tempo rule + endgame control already capture most tempo value |
| TEMPO_SEEK v2 (premium trumps allowed for big follow-ups) | 53% h2h, n=150 | +5 over v1 in the predicted direction but still within noise; off |
| ANY_PAIR_OVER_JUNK (last-resort pair leads at any level) | 52% h2h tie, n=150 | control-leads hierarchy already avoids most passive junk |
| mc-strong (N=30) | 61% ≈ default | sampling isn't the bottleneck; rollout quality is |

## Human-play validation set

Logs are the corpus (`logs/*.jsonl`, gitignored; server logs fetched via
`fetch_fly_logs.sh`). As of 2026-08-01: 245 genuine human play decisions
(per-play bot flag — watchdog takeovers excluded), 227 with outcome labels
converted to training shards (`rl/human_shards.py`).
- Agreement (all policies): heuristic 52%, smart 51%, mc 50%, rl-bc 49% —
  a STYLE metric, not strength (ranking inverts the Elo ladder).
- Gap decomposition: forced plays 100% agreement (after the exhaustive
  follow-enumeration fix; previously ~20% of humans' legal plays in narrow
  spots weren't on the ballot); leads 19% vs follows 59%; of disagreements,
  62% are value-ties (|Δ|≤3 pts), 23% favor the bot, 15% favor the human
  (mean -0.8). Realistic agreement ceiling for ANY policy: ~65-70%.
- Uses: regression tripwire (a policy dropping to ~30% = broken — would
  have caught the DMC collapse instantly); distribution-shift check for RL
  checkpoints; future human-style fine-tune.

## Lessons

- **Measure everything; adopt nothing on intuition.** Feature toggles +
  mirrored evals found every real gain and killed every plausible-but-wrong
  idea. Single-opponent numbers mislead: rate against the pool.
- **Hoarding loses, tempo wins** — every measured failure withheld strength
  (reserve, draining); every win spent it sooner (in-suit contesting, safe
  throws +17pt, eager declaration). The expert refinement that survived:
  contest everything in the endgame, not "save the big one for last".
- **Search beats heuristics; guarded search beats raw search.** MCBot's
  margin (heuristic prior unless the search is confident) out-rated pure
  argmax by 45 Elo — early-lead rollouts are noise-dominated.
- **Learned-policy pitfalls are measurable**: BC clones inherit skill but
  not robustness (29% vs the search); naive value regression destroys a
  pretrained policy's ordering before it can rebuild (audit: candidate
  score spread 22.5 → 0.26). Dense per-candidate targets (distillation)
  and anchored objectives are the countermeasures.
- **The expert-iteration chain works (2026-08-01 night)**: distill the
  search's EVALUATIONS, not its choices — its choices are part RNG
  (10-world sampling decides near-ties), so train toward
  softmax(candidate values/T) (v4, +6pts) and feed it enough data (v5,
  2.6M decisions, +4 more). The student comes out SEARCH-RESISTANT (38%
  vs MCBot; BC clone: 29%) because it learned the judge's values instead
  of a fixed teacher's habits. Then close the loop: that student as
  MCBot's rollout policy beat plain MCBot 55% — the first agent above
  the champion — confirming the sweeps' finding that rollout quality was
  flat-MC's binding constraint. Better net → better search → (next)
  better teacher.
