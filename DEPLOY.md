# Deploying Sheng Ji

The server is a **single stateful process**: rooms and games live in memory,
clients hold WebSockets to it. That drives every deployment rule below.

## Ground rules (any host)

- **Exactly one instance.** No replicas, no autoscaling, no serverless. Two
  instances would each hold half the rooms.
- A restart drops in-progress games (players see "That game has ended.").
  Deploy when it's quiet.
- TLS is handled by the platform/proxy; the frontend auto-selects `wss://`
  on https pages (same-origin), no config needed.
- Health check: `GET /healthz`.
- Pick the bot with `SHENGJI_BOT` (`mc` is the current default/search
  incumbent; `smart` is much cheaper; `heuristic` is easiest — see
  AI_POLICIES.md). `rl-override-v11pair` is a promising cost candidate, not a
  confirmed replacement, and requires its checkpoint/dependencies.

## Option A: Fly.io (recommended)

```bash
brew install flyctl && fly auth login
fly launch --copy-config --no-deploy   # uses fly.toml; pick an app name
fly volumes create shengji_data --size 1   # ONE volume (see below)
fly deploy --ha=false                      # ONE machine (see below)
```

`fly.toml` already pins an always-on machine (512MB is plenty — the engine
is tiny) with `auto_stop_machines = "off"` so idle games aren't killed.
Custom domain: `fly certs add yourdomain.com` + a CNAME.

Two Fly defaults to override (learned the hard way):
- **`--ha=false` is required**: plain `fly deploy` creates TWO machines for
  "high availability", but rooms live in one machine's memory — the proxy
  would route players randomly between machines and rooms would appear
  missing. If you end up with two, `fly machine destroy <id> --force` one.
- **Ignore the volume redundancy warning** (`-n 2`): one machine means one
  volume. Extra volumes get claimed by phantom machines and wedge deploys
  ("volume already claimed" / "needs an unattached volume") — destroy
  extras with `fly volumes destroy <vol_id>`.

## Option B: any VPS with Docker

```bash
docker build -t shengji .
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 shengji
```

Put Caddy in front for TLS (Caddyfile: `yourdomain.com { reverse_proxy
localhost:8000 }`) — Caddy proxies WebSockets automatically.

## Option C: zero-deploy for friends

Tailscale (invite friends to your tailnet, run the server locally) or a
Cloudflare Tunnel. No code or config changes needed.

## Capacity

Policy cost, not the rules engine, sets CPU capacity. On the measured mini,
SmartBot is p50 0.05ms / p95 0.13ms, direct v11pair is 0.25ms / 0.52ms on the
numpy path, and the default MCBot is 77ms / 150ms per decision at N=10. The
0.7s bot pacing delay hides response latency from a player but does not remove
CPU work, so do not infer “dozens of concurrent MC rooms” from the pacing
alone. Load-test the chosen policy and expected mix before advertising a room
limit. Memory per room is small; scaling a single-process deployment beyond
its measured CPU envelope would require external state and room-affinity
routing, deliberately out of scope for now.
