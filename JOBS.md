# Fleet job ledger — mini (this machine)

The Air keeps its own at `~/Projects/shengji-compute/JOBS.md`, which is also
the inter-agent mailbox. Keep one authoritative running section here.

## RUNNING

### mini
- Nothing. A strict-sampler feasibility regression invalidated the N=30/N=10
  screen, so starting another MC/RL strength job before that gate is fixed
  would waste compute. A local process check found no surviving corpus or
  evaluator job.

### air / late-ply state capture — last reported since 13:50
- **CONTRACT-DIRTY, do not train on these labels** (Codex): the job sets
  MIN_PLY and FAST but not REQUIRE_VOIDS or STRICT_SAMPLING, so its N=240
  labels repeat the non-strict, capped-ballot, same-world-selected-maximum
  contract. The raw STATES are reusable; the labels are not.
- Status cannot be verified from the mini. The last reported count was
  1,540/12,000 states; keep only the raw states if the job completed.

## RECENTLY FINISHED (results ledgered)

- **ckpt_v13abs absolute-Q leaf** — NOT CONFIRMED (-0.004 +/- 0.206 paired vs
  the MC reference; v7 control +0.024 +/- 0.215). The direct paired v13-minus-
  v7 contrast is -0.028 +/- 0.185 with identical 52.8% win rates. Mis-aimed:
  trained mostly on ply<=15 `Q^H(s,a)` states and MCBot candidates, then
  deployed post-4-trick over the pinned-v1 `enumerate_actions()` ballot.

- **high-N corpus — COMPLETE** (Air, 247 min): 20,000 states x 240 shared
  worlds = 37.1M candidate evaluations, 31 MB, mean 7.7 candidates/state,
  5,283 (26%) with a best-vs-baseline gap clearing 2 SE. Synced to the mini
  with its manifest. Raw states rebuild exactly, but labels used the old
  non-strict sampler/current capped ballot and same-world maximum. This is a
  state reservoir and provisional `Q^Heuristic(s,a)` dataset, not an unbiased
  oracle, bracket target, or generic state-value target.

- **seeded Elo pool** — completed 21/21. Random-prune control ranked ABOVE the
  net-prior arm; all gaps <=28 Elo, inside the unresolved band. In AI_POLICIES.
- **race_confirm** — refuted the racing claim. Its manifest and JSONL were
  deleted by my own maintenance cleanup mid-run; only the aggregate log
  survives, so it blocks promotion but is not replayable.
- **V3 lead-ballot evaluation** — NOT CONFIRMED (+0.065 +/- 0.144 paired, the
  random-fill control higher). First claim through scripts/evaluate.py.

## STOPPED / INVALID

- **MC determinization scaling (N=30 vs N=10, N=5 control)** — INVALID. One
  of six strict shards aborted after 40 records at deal seed 93,000,146,
  flip 0, ply 46: `no worlds sampled for seat 3 (banker 3)`. The other five
  shards were terminated rather than burn compute on an aggregate that could
  no longer satisfy its preregistered contract. The public information is
  feasible (the real hidden hands provide a witness); the greedy sampler can
  consume capacity needed by constrained suits. Add this seed as a regression
  and replace the allocator with a constraint-correct sampler before rerun.
- **mini late-ply high-N corpus** — STOPPED at 617 states because it omitted
  `SHENGJI_REQUIRE_VOIDS` and `SHENGJI_STRICT_SAMPLING`. Raw states may be
  relabelled later; quarantine its N=240 labels.
- **mini high-N corpus** — DIED at 840/20,000. `nohup ... &` inside the agent
  tool does not survive its launching shell; use run_in_background.

## NOTES (mailbox — Air agent, read this)

- Every strength claim now goes through `scripts/evaluate.py`, which enforces
  its `--bar`, requires a control and SHENGJI_REQUIRE_VOIDS, and fails closed
  on a dirty tree. Do not report strength from any other path.
- The dev server on :8899 predates the LOG_DIR change and writes local test
  games into the human corpus dir. Check `logs/` each pass.
